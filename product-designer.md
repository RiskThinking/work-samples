# Work Sample for Product Designer

You are given a [recording of our VELE®️ app](https://rtai.notion.site/VELO-Assets-Views-269b0355c14a429f9fb3baa26fec0fc8) focusing on its "Assets" views and visualizations. Use that as a reference to work through the following tasks.

## Task 1: Data Table/List Revisions

- Revise the `Summary` (a list of entities) and `Detail` (a list of assets of selected entity from `Summary`) data tables (and their container views if necessary) to improve their clarity, usability, and visual appeal.
- Consider factors such as sorting, filtering, and displaying additional contextual information.

Provide the revision in the form of low or high fedility mockups, along with any additional documentation to support your decisions.

## Task 2: Visualization Revisions

- Revise the visualizations found in the `Climate Data` view.
- This could involve making the data more comprehensible, improving the color scheme for better accessibility, or suggesting alternative visualization types.

Provide the revision in the form of low or high fedility mockups, along with any additional documentation to support your decisions.

## Task 3: User Flow Optimizations

- Based on the given recording, identify and document the user flow in the form of one or multiple flowchart(s).
- You may make fair assumptions of scenarios that are not directly visible in the recording and include them in the flowcharts.
- Optimize the user flow which could involve improving navigation, reducing the number of steps, or suggesting ways to guide users more effectively

Provide the before and after flowcharts with clear labelling of the suggested optimizations.

## Notes

- You are encouraged to use existing design elements and systems to facilitate the mockups.
- You are welcome to use any tools to achieve the goal.
- You can use AI assistants (such as ChatGPT, Bing Chat, DALL-E, Microsoft Designer, etc.).
- You are encouraged to ask any questions you may have during the hiring process, including but not limited to the work sample itself.
- Remember that the amount and the dimension of the data we work with are much higher in reality, so try to demonstrate that your solutions can handle beyond the sample scale.
- You are welcome to keep your solutions public as a part of your professional portfolio.

## Submission

- Submit your solutions through publicly accessible means, such as Notion, Figma/FigJam, etc.
- For any AI assistants interactions and logs, retain and share them as a part of your solutions.
- Reply to the original work sample email with all applicable links of your work sample solutions.
