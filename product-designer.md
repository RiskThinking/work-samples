# Work Sample for Product Designer

Assess the [recording of our VELO®️ app](https://rtai.notion.site/VELO-Assets-Views-269b0355c14a429f9fb3baa26fec0fc8) focusing on its "Assets" views and visualizations. Use that as a reference to work through the following tasks.

## Task 1: Data Table and Visualization Revisions

- Assess the `Summary` view (a list of entities) and `Detail` view (a list of assets of a selected entity from `Summary`) and their data tables, and make revisions to improve their clarity, usability, and visual appeal.
- Assess the `Climate Data` view and its visualizations, make revisions that could involve making the data more comprehensible, improving the colour scheme for better accessibility, or suggesting alternative visualization types.
- Consider factors such as sorting, filtering, and displaying additional contextual information.

Provide the revision in low or high-fidelity mockups, and any additional documentation to support your decisions.

## Task 2: User Flow Optimizations

- From the recording, identify and document the user flow in one or multiple flowchart(s).
- You may make fair assumptions of scenarios not directly visible in the recording and include them in the flowcharts.
- Optimize the user flow, which could involve improving navigation, reducing the number of steps, or suggesting ways to guide users more effectively.

Provide the before and after flowcharts with clear labelling of the suggested optimizations.

## Task 3: Design for New Feature Request

- Consider a hypothetical new feature request where **the user can select multiple percentiles in the `Climate Data` view**.
- Provide an ideation process, including user stories, functional/non-functional requirements, wireframes, and mockups. Consider how this feature would fit into the revised application and the optimized user flow.
