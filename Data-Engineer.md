# Work Sample for Data Engineer

Solve the following problems using a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) oriented tool, such as Pachyderm, Airflow, Dagster, etc.

## Problem 1: Climate Data Processing

**Objective**: Ingest and transform raw climate data.

### Tasks:
1. Implement data tasks to ingest raw climate data from multiple sources and transform it into a common format.
2. Output resulting dataset into a structured format (e.g., Parquet).
3. Optimize performance and throughput by leveraging means such as parallelization, multiprocessing, multithreading, etc.

## Problem 2: Finance Data Processing

**Objective**: Ingest and transform raw financial data.

### Tasks:
1. Implement data tasks to ingest financial data and transform into a format that can be joined against the Climate Data from Problem 1 on geo and time signals.
2. Output resulting dataset into a structure format (e.g., Parquet).
3. Optimize performance and throughput by leveraging means such as parallelization, multiprocessing, multithreading, etc.

## Problem 3: ML Training

**Objective**: Integrate climate and finance data using geo and time signals, perform machine learning to train a predictive model.

### Tasks:
1. Integrate climate and finance data using geo and time signals.
2. _WIP details_

## Problem 4: Model Serving

**Objective**: Build an API service to serve the trained predictive model.

### Tasks:
1. Implement an API service to serve the trained predictive model.
2. _WIP details_
3. (Bonus) Implement reasonable tests for data processing tasks from Problems 1-3.
