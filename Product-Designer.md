# Work Sample for Product Designer

You are tasked with designing the user interface for a climate risk dashboard web app. Your goal is to create a cohesive and user-friendly design that allows users to interact with the provided dataset and gain insights into climate change and its risk implications.

You may refer to the [Climate Risk Rating dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y_yiT-_7IimioBvcqiCPwLzTLazfdRyzZ4k3cpQXiAw) to assist with your solutions.

## Problem 1: Information Architecture and Wireframing

**Objective**: Create an intuitive and organized information architecture for the web app and develop wireframes (using any tools you prefer) for key components and a view.

### Tasks:
1. Design a high-level information architecture that outlines the main navigation and data flow of the web app.
2. Develop a wireframe for a component that displays an interactive map to visualize risk scores by location. Consider possible filters on decades, business categories, assets, and risk factors.
3. Develop a wireframe for a component that showcases the climate risk data in a tabular format with sorting and filtering capabilities. Consider the possibility of the real-world data scale is much larger.
4. Develop a wireframe for a component that presents a line graph visualization of risk levels over time for similar filters designed for the map and the data table components.
5. Develop a view that combines the map, data table, and line graph components into a cohesive and intuitive interface.

## Problem 2: Visual Design

**Objective**: Create an appealing visual design for the *map component* that aligns with the project's goals.

### Task:
1. For the *map component* from Problem 1 Task 2, develop a visual design concept that reflects the theme of climate risk assessment, considering the target audience and the need for clear data visualization.

## Problem 3: Interaction Design and Prototyping

**Objective**: For the *map component*, design its interactions and transitions to enhance the user experience and demonstrate functionality.

### Tasks:
1. Define interactive elements such as buttons, dropdowns, sliders, tooltips and legends, ensuring they are intuitive and easy to use.
2. Design transitions and animations to provide visual feedback and enhance the user experience during interactions.
3. Create an interactive prototype using a design tool (e.g. Figma) to demonstrate the flow and interactions.

## Problem 4: Design System and Branding

**Objective**: Develop a minimal design system for consistent user experience and branding across other components, views, and product lines with the same key UI/UX elements developed for the *map component*.

### Tasks:
1. Create a style guide and design system that documents the interactive elements, typography, colours, and icons that are used in the *map component*.
2. Provide specifications and annotations for developers to accurately implement the design, including responsive behaviour for different screen sizes and platforms.

## Notes

- You are encouraged to use any existing base components and systems as your design foundation.
- You can use AI assistants (such as ChatGPT, Bing Chat, DALL-E, Microsoft Designer, etc.), but make sure to include the full interaction/chat log along with your solution.
- You are encouraged to ask any questions you may have during the hiring process, including but not limited to questions related to the work sample itself.
- Keep in mind that both the amount and the dimension of the data we work with are much higher in reality, so try to demonstrate that your solutions can handle beyond the sample scale.
- You are more than welcome to keep your solutions public as a part of your professional portfolio.

## Submission

1. For Problems 1-2 and possibly 4, host your solutions in a publicly accessible document, such as Notion, Google Slides, FigJam, etc.
2. For Problems 3 and possibly 4, host your solutions in a publicly accessible design tool, such as Figma (and FigJam), Adobe XD, etc.
3. For any AI assistants interactions and logs, retain and share them as a part of your solutions in a publicly accessible document tool, such as Notion, Google Docs, etc.
4. **Reply to the original work sample email** with all applicable links.
