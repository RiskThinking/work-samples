# Work Sample for Product Designer

You are assigned to design the web app interface for a climate risk dashboard. The goal is to create a cohesive, user-friendly design that enables users to interact with the provided dataset, gaining insights into climate change and its risk implications. This work sample focuses on three problem areas:
1. Information architecture and wireframing for two components (map, data table) and a view
2. Visual design and prototyping of the **map component**
3. A design system for consistency

You may refer to the [Climate Risk Rating dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y_yiT-_7IimioBvcqiCPwLzTLazfdRyzZ4k3cpQXiAw) to assist with your solutions.

## Problem 1: Information Architecture and Wireframing

**Objective**: Create an intuitive and organized information architecture for the web app and develop wireframes for two components and a view.

### Tasks:
1. Design a high-level information architecture that outlines the main navigation and data flow.
2. Develop a wireframe for a component that displays an interactive map to visualize risk scores by location. Consider possible filters on decades, business categories, assets, and risk factors.
3. Develop a wireframe for a component that showcases the climate risk data in a tabular format with sorting and filtering capabilities.
4. Develop a view that combines the map and data table into a cohesive and intuitive interface.

## Problem 2: Visual Design and Prototyping

**Objective**: Create an appealing visual design for the **map component** (from Problem 1 Task 2) that aligns with the project's goals, with interactions and transitions to enhance the user experience and demonstrate functionality.

### Task:
1. Develop a visual design concept that reflects the theme of climate risk assessment, considering the target audience and the need for clear data visualization.
2. Define interactive elements such as buttons, dropdowns, sliders, tooltips and legends, ensuring they are intuitive and easy to use.
3. Design transitions and animations to provide visual feedback to enhance the user experience during interactions.
4. Create an interactive prototype using a design tool (e.g. Figma) to demonstrate the flow and interactions.

## Problem 3: Design System and Branding

**Objective**: Develop a minimal design system for consistent user experience and branding across other components, views, and product lines with the same key UI/UX elements developed for the **map component**.

### Tasks:
1. Create a style guide and design system that documents the interactive elements, typography, colours, and icons used in the **map component**.
2. Provide specifications and annotations for developers to accurately implement the design, including responsive behaviour for different screen sizes and platforms.

## Notes

- You are encouraged to use existing base components and systems as your design foundation.
- You are welcome to use any tools to achieve the goal.
- You can use AI assistants (such as ChatGPT, Bing Chat, DALL-E, Microsoft Designer, etc.), but make sure to include the full interaction/chat log along with your solution.
- You are encouraged to ask any questions you may have during the hiring process, including but not limited to the work sample itself.
- Remember that the amount and the dimension of the data we work with are much higher in reality, so try to demonstrate that your solutions can handle beyond the sample scale.
- You are welcome to keep your solutions public as a part of your professional portfolio.

## Submission

1. Submit your solutions through publicly accessible means, such as Notion, Figma/FigJam, etc.
2. For any AI assistants interactions and logs, retain and share them as a part of your solutions.
3. **Reply to the original work sample email** with all links.
